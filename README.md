# Roomba-Disinfection

This is a project that build a cleaning model specifically for the surface under the table also high-touch surface objects based on the iRobot cleaner to disinfect the surface or objects to reduce health-care infection problems.

Implemented Raspberry Pi 4 for controlling and modifying the systems, with a robot arm attached on the robot for disinfecting the surface and high-touched objects by implementing CV program.

My main responsibility is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the object recognization program. I have implemented both serial approach and multi-threads approach.

In this project, we have to deal with the aggregation of subsystems for different real-time functions on the robot arm, iRobot, as well as on the Pi 4.

*We temporally use a regular flash ligh to mock the UV-light disinfection.*
